# front-end-mentor-qr-code
I spent less than 30 minuted putting this simple React component together. All of the source materials are from Front-end mentor

## ðŸ›  Tools
- create-react-app
- SASS CSS

## ðŸ§  Learnings
I focused on speed with this one. I set up the project quickly and kept my folder structure simple. I chose not to seperate all of my css simply because this component wouldn't be used as part of a larger project. The main thing here was using SASS and getting comfortable with working faster in a React environment.
